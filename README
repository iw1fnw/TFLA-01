The Fabulous Logic Analyzer #1
==============================

This is a simple logic analyzer software, originally written by Bernhard Walle.
The code has been ported to QT5 by Alberto Busso and it has been moved from
SourceForge to github for easy maintenance.
The latest version from Bernhard Walle is still available here:
https://sourceforge.net/projects/tfla-01.berlios/files/

A modified version running a 16 channels analyser has been also written by
Kevin Koster and is available here:
http://www.ombertech.com/cnk/tfla-16/index.htm

However, this is not yet ported in QT5 (it will be done soon).

Read the documentation in HTML format in the doc/user subdirectory to get
started with installation and running of the software.

Since the documentation is in DocBook and gets compiled during installation,
read http://www.ombertech.com/cnk/tfla-16/manual/en/ if you have a
source tarball and if you don't want to read XML sources.

The Fabulous Logic Analyzer #1
==============================

This is a simple logic analyzer software. Read the documentation in HTML format
in the doc/user subdirectory to get started with installation and running
of the software.

Since the documentation is in DocBook and gets compiled during installation,
read http://tfla-01.berlios.de/manual/en/ if you have a source tarball and if
you don't want to read XML sources.

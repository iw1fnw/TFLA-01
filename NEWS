0.5.0
-----
 * Fix build with old Qt versions.
 * Change channel numbers in the I2C menu.
 * Fix the entry time edit widget for the measuring time.
 * Fix problem that errors during data collection are suppressed on non-Windows
   platforms.
 * Improvements in the I2C analysing code by Jose Aparicio. Add the
   capability to analyse some chips like PCF8574/PCF8574A (I/O expander) and
   DS1307 (RTC).
 * Add a SPI analyzer like it's already there for I2C. Thanks to Kai Dorau for
   the contribution.
 * Make using the protocol analyzers more comfortable and implement a
   generic interface so that new analyzers could be added without
   adding user interface code.
 * Check for updates on startup.
 * Don't rely on the QTDIR environment to find the translations.
 * Also load the Qt translations from the current working directory. This enables
   translations on Windows.
